Pseudocodes of BFS:
------------------

Input -> Connected Graph and a "source"
Output -> Traverse all nodes and print the traversal order

Time Complexity - O(V+E)
Space Complexity - O(V)

BFS(graph, source):

- Initiate an array "visited" and an empty queue "q"
- mark visited[source] = 1 and q.push(source)
- while the queue is not empty:
   => head = q.front()
   => q.pop()
   => print the node "head"
   => for all adjacent nodes of "head":
      -> if visited[adj_node] == 0 then visited[adj_node] == 1 and q.push(adj_node);
